I am a Postdoctoral Associate and NSF/CRA Computing Innovation Fellow in [Mechanical Engineering](https://meche.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I am a member of Stochastic Analysis and Nonlinear Dynamics Lab under the direction of Prof. Themis Sapsis. My research interests span fundamental sciences, engineering and computing with current focus being on fluid mechanics, complex dynamical systems, machine learning and high-performance computing. In particular, I am studying fundamental problems in fluid turbulence and combustion using extremely parallel direct numerical simulations (DNS) to develop novel reduced order data-driven models and their implementation using computationally efficient algorithms.

I received my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University under the supervision of Prof. Diego Donzis. I completed my undergraduate education in Aerospace Engineering and Physics from Texas A&M University. I have also held short-term research appointments at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and New York University.
