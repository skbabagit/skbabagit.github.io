I am an Assitant Research Professor in [School of Mechanical, Aerospace & Manufacturing Engineering](https://me.engr.uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"} affliated with [Center for Clean Energy Engineering](https://www.energy.uconn.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Previously I was a Postdoctoral Associate and NSF/CRA Computing Innovation Fellow in [Mechanical Engineering](https://meche.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> as a member of [Stochastic Analysis and Nonlinear Dynamics Lab](https://sandlab.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} under the direction of [Prof. Themistoklis Sapsis](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/sapsis@mit.edu){:target="_blank"}. My research interests span fundamental sciences, engineering and computing with current focus being on fluid mechanics, complex dynamical systems, machine learning and high-performance computing. In particular, I am studying fundamental problems in [fluid turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence){:target="_blank"} using extremely [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing){:target="_blank"} [direct numerical simulations (DNS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_numerical_simulation){:target="_blank"} to develop novel reduced order data-driven models and their implementation using computationally efficient algorithms.

I received my Ph.D. in [Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/index.html){:target="_blank"} at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Prof. Diego Donzis](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/ddonzis.html){:target="_blank"}. I completed my undergraduate education in [Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Physics](https://physics.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"} from [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I have also held short-term research appointments at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
